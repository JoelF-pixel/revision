## Goal

Create a page draft that’s easy to scan and helps a user take the next step.

## Steps

1) Write the user need in one sentence
- Example: “As a user, I need to know what documents to bring so I can attend my appointment.”

2) Decide the page purpose
- What should the user do after reading this?

3) Draft headings first
- Headings should tell a story without body text.

4) Fill in the body using plain language
- Short sentences
- Active voice
- Common words

5) Make it scannable
- Use lists for steps/items
- Put important info early

## Common mistakes

- Trying to cover multiple user needs on one page
- Big paragraphs and buried actions
- Using internal terminology instead of user language
