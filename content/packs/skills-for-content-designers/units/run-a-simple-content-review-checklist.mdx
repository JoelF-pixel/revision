## Checklist

- Purpose: can I say what the page is for in one sentence?
- Next step: is the action obvious?
- Plain language: any jargon, acronyms, internal terms?
- Scannability: headings/lists, short paragraphs?
- Consistency: terms match elsewhere in the service?
- Errors: spelling, punctuation, formatting?

## Next step

Pick one risk and test it:
- Ask someone unfamiliar with the topic what they think they’re meant to do next.
