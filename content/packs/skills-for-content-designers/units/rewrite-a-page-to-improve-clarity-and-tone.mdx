## Goal

Practise improving real content (not writing from scratch).

## Steps

1) Pick a page
- Something with long sentences, lots of jargon, or unclear actions.

2) Identify the problems
- What might confuse a stressed or distracted user?

3) Rewrite for clarity
- Shorten sentences
- Put the action up front
- Replace jargon with plain words

4) Adjust tone
- Be direct, not abrupt
- Be calm, not patronising

5) Compare versions
- What got easier to understand?
- What became more consistent?
