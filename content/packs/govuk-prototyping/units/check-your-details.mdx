title: Check your details (pattern)
summary: Implement a realistic “check your answers” page with change links that return to the summary.
estimatedMinutes: 45
difficulty: working
doneWhen:
  - "Your summary page displays answers captured from previous pages."
  - "Change links let users edit answers and return to the summary page."

## Goal

Build a realistic **Check your details** page that behaves like a real service:
- users review answers
- users can change answers
- after a change they return to the summary

## When to use

Use this pattern when you need a credible end-to-end journey (UR, stakeholder demos, handoff).

## Steps

1) Build a short journey (2–3 questions) that stores answers in session.
2) Create a summary page ("check your details") that outputs those answers.
3) Add **Change** links that take the user back to the relevant question page.
4) Intercept the form submission for the changed answer so you can **redirect back to the summary**.

## Code (minimal example)

### A) Add a flag when the user hits the summary

```js
// routes.js
router.get('/check-your-details', function (req, res) {
  req.session.data.__journeyComplete = true
  return res.render('check-your-details')
})
```

### B) Route the “changed answer” POST via routes.js

Instead of posting to the next page, post to a route handler:

```html
<form action="/question-1-answer" method="post">
  <!-- inputs -->
</form>
```

Then redirect depending on whether we’re in “change-mode” (journey complete):

```js
// routes.js
router.post('/question-1-answer', function (req, res) {
  const complete = req.session.data.__journeyComplete

  if (complete) {
    return res.redirect('/check-your-details')
  }

  return res.redirect('/question-2')
})
```

## Common mistakes

- Posting directly to the next page (`action="question-2"`) so you can’t intercept the redirect.
- Forgetting to reset `__journeyComplete` when restarting the journey.
- Not handling the case where changing an answer should trigger additional questions.
