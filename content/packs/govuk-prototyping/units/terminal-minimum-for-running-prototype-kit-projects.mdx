title: Terminal minimum for running Prototype Kit projects
summary: Learn the small set of terminal commands you need to install dependencies, run the kit, and read errors.
estimatedMinutes: 20

doneWhen:
  - You can navigate into a repo directory using `cd`.
  - You can install dependencies with `npm install`.
  - You can start and stop the dev server (`npm run dev`, then `Ctrl + C`).
  - You can use Tab to autocomplete paths.

## Goal

Be self-sufficient enough to run a prototype kit and diagnose basic issues.

## Commands you will use constantly

Navigation:
- Where am I?: `pwd`
- What’s in this folder?: `ls`
- Go home: `cd ~` (or just `cd`)
- Go into a folder: `cd folder-name`
- Go up one folder: `cd ..`
- Autocomplete a path: press `Tab`

Running the kit:
- Install packages: `npm install`
- Run locally (common): `npm run dev` (sometimes `npm start`)
- Stop it: `Ctrl + C`

Tip:
- Use the up arrow to cycle through previous commands.

## Recommended folder layout (Mac)

Keep projects in one predictable place.

Example:
- `mkdir -p ~/Repos`
- `cd ~/Repos`
- `git clone <repo-url>`
- `cd <repo-folder>`

## Using Terminal inside VS Code (optional but efficient)

If you don’t want a separate Terminal window:
- VS Code menu: View → Terminal
- Toggle terminal panel: `Ctrl + \``
- Focus editor: `Ctrl + 1`

## Common problems

- **"command not found: npm"** → Node/npm isn’t installed correctly (or PATH is wrong).
- **You’re in the wrong folder** → run `pwd` and check you’re inside the repo.
- **The server won’t stop** → make sure your terminal has focus, then press `Ctrl + C`.
- **Weird missing module errors** → try `npm install` again; if still broken, deleting `node_modules` is a last resort.
