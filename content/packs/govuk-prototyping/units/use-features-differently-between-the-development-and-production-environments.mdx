summary: Add simple switches so prototypes behave differently when developing vs sharing.

## Goal

Keep dev conveniences without leaking them into shared prototypes.

## Steps

1) Decide what should differ between dev and shared environments.
2) Use an environment variable (or config) to gate the behaviour.
3) Verify both modes.
