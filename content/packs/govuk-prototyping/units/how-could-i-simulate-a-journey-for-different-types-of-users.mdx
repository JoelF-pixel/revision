  - "A user can choose a type and the journey adapts accordingly."
  - "At least one page changes content based on user type."
  - "You can reset/clear the user type to test other paths."

## Goal

Represent user segmentation (roles, eligibility, needs) inside a prototype.

## Steps

1) Define 2–3 user types.
2) Add an entry point to select a type (or infer via data).
3) Branch the journey with routing logic.
4) Add a clear reset mechanism.
