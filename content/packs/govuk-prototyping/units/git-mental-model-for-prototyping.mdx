## Goal

Use Git confidently enough that you don’t avoid it.

## The 4 concepts you actually need

1) **Working tree**
- The files on your laptop.

2) **Commit**
- A named snapshot of your files.
- If you can’t undo a mistake, it’s usually because you didn’t commit.

3) **Branch**
- A label pointing at a series of commits.
- You make branches so you can change things without breaking `main`.

4) **Remote (GitHub)**
- A copy of your repo on the internet.
- You push/pull to sync.

## Practical workflow (the happy path)

1) Make a branch
- `git checkout -b my-change`

2) Make a small change

3) Commit
- `git status`
- `git add -A`
- `git commit -m "Explain what changed"`

4) Push
- `git push -u origin my-change`

5) Open a PR
- Review + merge.

## What to do when you’re scared

- Commit more often.
- Keep commits small.
- If you’re unsure, create a branch first. Branches are cheap.
