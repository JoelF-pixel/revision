## Goal

Speed up the boring bits: navigation, formatting, and repetitive edits.

## The one VS Code feature to master: Command Palette

Open the command palette:
- `Shift + CMD + P`

Why it matters:
- Almost everything VS Code can do is available here.
- Extensions also show up here.
- Recently-used actions float to the top.

### Useful command palette patterns
Try these once so they’re “in your hands”:

- **Change the case of text**
  1) Select text
  2) `Shift + CMD + P`
  3) Type part of the command name (for example: `sent`)
  4) Pick the case-changing command and press Enter

- **Turn lines into bullet points (Markdown)**
  1) Select a few lines
  2) `Shift + CMD + P`
  3) Search for “bullet” / list formatting
  4) Apply

- **Wrap selected text**
  - Select text → `Shift + CMD + P` → search “wrap”

## Keyboard shortcuts worth memorising (Mac)

You do not need 50 shortcuts. Learn ~10 and you’ll feel it immediately.

Editing:
- Move line(s) up/down: `Alt + Up/Down`
- Duplicate line(s) up/down: `Alt + Shift + Up/Down`
- Comment/uncomment line: `CMD + /`
- Toggle word wrap: `Alt + Z`

Navigation:
- Start/end of line: `CMD + Left/Right`
- Jump to line: `Ctrl + G`
- Switch tabs: `Alt + CMD + Left/Right`

App switching loop (fast prototyping):
- Save: `CMD + S`
- Switch app: `CMD + Tab`
- Reload browser: `CMD + R`

## A practical mini-exercise (5 minutes)

1) Open any template in your prototype (for example `app/views/...`)
2) Make a small change (add a hint, fix a label)
3) Use only keyboard to:
- save
- switch to browser
- refresh
- switch back

Repeat 3 times.

## Common problems

- **Command palette feels slow** → it gets fast once you stop aiming for the perfect command name; type a few letters and hit Enter.
- **Shortcuts don’t work** → check for conflicts (some apps override global shortcuts).
