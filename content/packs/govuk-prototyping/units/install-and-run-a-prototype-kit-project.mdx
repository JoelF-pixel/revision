## Goal

Get a prototype kit project running locally.

## Steps

1) Clone the repository
- `git clone <repo-url>`
- `cd <repo>`

2) Install dependencies
- `npm install`

3) Start the server
- Run whichever script the repo provides:
  - `npm run dev` (common for Next.js / modern projects)
  - `npm start` (common for the prototype kit)

4) Open the site
- The terminal will print the URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

## If it fails

- **Read the first error** in the terminal output (ignore the noise below it).
- Common fixes:
  - Wrong Node version → install/switch to the required Node version.
  - `npm install` fails → delete `node_modules` + `package-lock.json` then reinstall (only if you understand you’re re-resolving deps).
  - Port already in use → stop the other server or change port.
