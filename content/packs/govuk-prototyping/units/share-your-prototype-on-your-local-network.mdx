## Goal

Share your prototype with someone nearby without deploying it.

## Steps

1) Start your dev server
- `npm start` (or `npm run dev`)

2) Find the LAN URL
- Many dev servers print something like:
  - Local: `http://localhost:3000`
  - Network: `http://192.168.x.x:3000`

3) If you don’t see a network URL
- Find your IP address (Mac):
  - System Settings → Network → Wi‑Fi → Details

4) Give the URL to a colleague
- Example: `http://192.168.1.9:3000`

## Common problems

- **Firewall blocks it** → allow incoming connections for Node / your dev server.
- **Different Wi‑Fi** → they must be on the same network.
- **VPN** → can interfere; try disabling if it’s safe to do so.
