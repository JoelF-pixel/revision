## Goal

Make your coding setup “low friction” for prototype kit work.

## Steps

1) Standardise on VS Code
- Use **Visual Studio Code** unless you have a strong reason not to.
- The main benefit is supportability: other designers/engineers can help you, pair with you, and recommend extensions.

2) Maximise screen space
- Ideal: **two screens**.
  - Screen 1: VS Code
  - Screen 2: Browser + DevTools
- If you only have one screen, aim for a layout where you can quickly get to:
  - VS Code
  - Terminal output (build status + errors)
  - Browser

Mac tip:
- System Settings → Desktop & Dock → enable **Automatically hide and show the Dock**.

3) Keep Terminal output visible
- When a prototype is running, the terminal tells you:
  - whether it rebuilt successfully
  - what route/template crashed
  - stack traces and warnings

Practical options:
- Terminal as a separate window beside VS Code, or
- Terminal inside VS Code (View → Terminal).

4) Store repos in a consistent location
Pick one folder and stick to it.

Example (Mac):
- Create a folder:
  - `mkdir -p ~/Repos`
- Put all prototype projects inside:
  - `~/Repos/dfe-something`
  - `~/Repos/nhse-something-else`

The payoff: terminal navigation becomes muscle memory.

5) Use a tight “edit → save → reload” loop
A fast loop keeps you in flow:
- Save: `CMD + S`
- Switch app: `CMD + Tab`
- Reload browser: `CMD + R`
- Switch back: `CMD + Tab`

## Common problems

- **You can’t see errors** → make Terminal output visible (or use VS Code’s integrated terminal).
- **Repos scattered everywhere** → pick one `~/Repos` (or `~/Projects`) folder and move projects into it.
- **Too much window switching** → try a second monitor, or lean harder on keyboard shortcuts.
