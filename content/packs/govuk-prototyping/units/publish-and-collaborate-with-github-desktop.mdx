## Goal

Use a GUI for Git so you can focus on prototyping, not Git syntax.

## Prerequisite

You should be comfortable doing simple things in Terminal (e.g. `cd`, `ls`, running `npm` commands). If not, do the **Terminal basics** skill first.

## Steps

1) Install GitHub Desktop
- https://desktop.github.com/

2) Sign in and clone the repo
- File → Clone Repository → choose the repo.

3) Create a branch
- Branch → New Branch…
- Name it after the change.

4) Commit
- Make a change in your editor.
- In GitHub Desktop, review changed files.
- Add a clear commit message.
- Click **Commit**.

5) Push + PR
- Click **Publish branch**.
- Click **Create Pull Request**.

## Tips

- Keep PRs small. One change per PR is ideal.
- If you get conflicts, pull from main first and resolve them in your editor.
