## What is this skill?

Pattern library management involves organizing, documenting, and maintaining a collection of custom components and patterns within a large prototype or across multiple prototypes.

## Why is it important?

- **Discoverability** – Team members can find and use existing patterns
- **Consistency** – Ensure patterns are used correctly across the project
- **Maintenance** – Keep track of what needs updating when requirements change
- **Onboarding** – Help new team members understand available components
