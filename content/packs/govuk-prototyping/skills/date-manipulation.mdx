## What is this skill?

Date manipulation involves calculating dates (like "3 working days from now"), formatting dates for display, and comparing dates in your prototype logic. The date-fns library is commonly used for this.

## Why is it important?

- **Dynamic deadlines** – Show realistic future dates based on today
- **Date formatting** – Display dates in the GOV.UK style (1 January 2024)
- **Validation** – Check if dates are in the past or future
- **Calculations** – Add or subtract days, months, or years
