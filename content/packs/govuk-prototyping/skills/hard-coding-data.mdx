## What is this skill?

Hard-coding data means placing static content directly into pages for quick testing, rather than pulling it from session data or external sources. This is useful for rapid prototyping.

## Why is it important?

- **Speed** – Quickly test page designs without setting up data flows
- **Simplicity** – Easier to understand when learning the kit
- **Demonstration** – Show stakeholders a specific scenario without complex logic
- **Starting point** – Often the first step before making content dynamic
