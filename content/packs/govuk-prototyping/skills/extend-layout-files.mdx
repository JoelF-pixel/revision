## What is this skill?

Extending layout files involves using Nunjucks template inheritance to modify block structures for specific page needs, creating custom layouts that still inherit from the base template.

## Why is it important?

- **Customisation** – Create page-specific layouts while maintaining consistency
- **Efficiency** – Reuse common structures across multiple pages
- **Flexibility** – Override only the blocks you need to change
- **Maintainability** – Keep your codebase organised and DRY
