## What is this skill?

Filtering data involves using logic to display specific subsets of information from arrays or objects based on conditions, such as showing only completed tasks or matching search results.

## Why is it important?

- **Dynamic displays** – Show only relevant items from larger datasets
- **Search results** – Filter lists based on user queries
- **Status filtering** – Display items by their current state
- **Performance** – Show manageable subsets of large data sets
