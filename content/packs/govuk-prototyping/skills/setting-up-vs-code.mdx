## What is this skill?

Setting up VS Code (Visual Studio Code) involves configuring the editor with helpful extensions and settings for prototyping work. This includes syntax highlighting for Nunjucks, code formatting, and integrated terminal access.

## Why is it important?

- **Productivity** – A well-configured editor speeds up your development workflow
- **Error prevention** – Syntax highlighting helps you spot mistakes early
- **Consistency** – Formatters ensure your code follows a consistent style
- **Integrated workflow** – Run terminal commands and edit files in one place
