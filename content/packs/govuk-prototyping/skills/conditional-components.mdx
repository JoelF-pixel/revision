## What is this skill?

Conditional components involves showing or hiding entire components based on user data or logic, such as only displaying certain form fields when relevant conditions are met.

## Why is it important?

- **Relevant content** – Only show what's applicable to each user
- **Cleaner interfaces** – Reduce clutter by hiding irrelevant elements
- **Progressive disclosure** – Reveal information as it becomes relevant
- **Dynamic forms** – Adapt the interface based on earlier answers
