## What is this skill?

Understanding different data types means knowing the difference between strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. This is essential for handling user input and building logic.

## Why is it important?

- **Correct comparisons** – Comparing "1" (string) and 1 (number) behaves differently
- **Form handling** – Form inputs are always strings; you may need to convert them
- **Conditional logic** – Booleans are essential for branching
- **Data structures** – Arrays and objects let you manage lists and complex data
