## What is this skill?

Backing up prototypes involves creating copies of your work at key milestones, typically using Git commits, branches, or zip archives. This protects against accidental changes and allows you to return to previous versions.

## Why is it important?

- **Safety net** – Recover from accidental deletions or breaking changes
- **Version history** – Return to any previous state of your prototype
- **Research rounds** – Maintain snapshots for different user research sessions
- **Collaboration** – Share specific versions with team members
