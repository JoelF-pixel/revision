## What is this skill?

Multi-user testing involves setting up your prototype to simulate scenarios where multiple users interact with the same case or application, such as an applicant and a caseworker viewing the same submission.

## Why is it important?

- **Realistic scenarios** – Many services involve multiple user types
- **Role switching** – Test both sides of a two-sided service
- **Data consistency** – Ensure both users see the same information
- **Complex journeys** – Test handoffs between different user types
