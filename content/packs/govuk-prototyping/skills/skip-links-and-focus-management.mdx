## What is this skill?

Skip links allow keyboard users to bypass repeated navigation and jump to main content. Focus management ensures the keyboard focus moves to the right place after page changes or dynamic updates.

## Why is it important?

- **Accessibility requirement** – Skip links are essential for keyboard users
- **Screen reader users** – Saves time navigating past headers and menus
- **Dynamic content** – Focus must move appropriately after form submissions
- **WCAG compliance** – Required for accessibility standards
