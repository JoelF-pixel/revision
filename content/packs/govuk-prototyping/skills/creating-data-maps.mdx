## What is this skill?

Creating data maps involves structuring user input into organised data objects or JSON structures, transforming flat form data into meaningful hierarchies.

## Why is it important?

- **Organised data** – Keep user responses structured and easy to access
- **Complex forms** – Handle multi-part forms with nested data
- **API simulation** – Mimic how real services structure data
- **Check answers pages** – Easily iterate over structured data for summaries
