## What is this skill?

Restarting the kit involves stopping and starting the prototype server, which is sometimes necessary after making changes to routes.js or installing new packages. Most view changes don't require a restart.

## Why is it important?

- **Apply changes** – Some changes only take effect after a restart
- **Fix frozen states** – Restart when the kit becomes unresponsive
- **Clear caches** – A restart can resolve unexpected behaviour
- **Know when it's needed** – Understand which changes require a restart and which don't
