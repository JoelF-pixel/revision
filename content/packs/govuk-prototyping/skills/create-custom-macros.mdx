## What is this skill?

Creating custom macros involves building your own reusable Nunjucks components that accept parameters and output HTML, similar to how GOV.UK Frontend components work.

## Why is it important?

- **Reusability** – Build once, use across multiple pages
- **Consistency** – Ensure the same pattern looks identical everywhere
- **Maintainability** – Update the macro once to fix issues everywhere
- **Team efficiency** – Share components with colleagues
