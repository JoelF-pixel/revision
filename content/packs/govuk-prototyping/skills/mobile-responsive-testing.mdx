## What is this skill?

Mobile responsive testing involves checking your prototype works well on different screen sizes, particularly mobile phones. The GOV.UK Design System is mobile-first, but custom additions need testing.

## Why is it important?

- **Real usage patterns** – Many users access services on mobile devices
- **Design system compliance** – Verify GOV.UK components respond correctly
- **Custom component testing** – Check your additions work on small screens
- **User research preparation** – Some sessions may use mobile devices
