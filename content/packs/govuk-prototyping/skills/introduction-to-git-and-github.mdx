## What is this skill?

Git is a version control system that tracks changes to your files over time. GitHub is a website that hosts Git repositories online, making it easy to back up your work and collaborate with others. Understanding the basics of both is essential before you start prototyping.

## Why is it important?

- **Save your work safely** – Git lets you save snapshots of your prototype that you can return to
- **Undo mistakes** – Accidentally break something? Git lets you go back to a working version
- **Collaboration** – Share your prototype with team members through GitHub
- **Industry standard** – Git is used everywhere in software development
