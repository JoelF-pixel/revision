## What is this skill?

Confirmation pages are the "end of journey" screens that tell users they've successfully completed a task. They include reference numbers, next steps, and important information.

## Why is it important?

- **User confidence** – Confirms the action was successful
- **Next steps** – Tells users what happens next and what they need to do
- **Reference information** – Provides details users may need later
- **Journey completion** – Essential for testing the full user experience
