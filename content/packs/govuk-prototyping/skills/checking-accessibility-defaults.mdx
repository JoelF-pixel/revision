## What is this skill?

Checking accessibility defaults involves verifying that components have proper ARIA attributes, labels, and focus states built in, and understanding what accessibility features come out of the box.

## Why is it important?

- **Compliance** – Ensure your prototype meets accessibility standards
- **Inclusive design** – Components work for users with disabilities
- **Testing confidence** – Know what's already handled vs what you need to add
- **Learning** – Understand accessibility best practices through examples
