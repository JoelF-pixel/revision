## What is this skill?

Accessibility testing basics involves using built-in browser tools and simple checks to ensure your prototype can be used by people with disabilities. This includes checking keyboard navigation, colour contrast, and screen reader compatibility.

## Why is it important?

- **Legal requirement** – Public sector services must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Inclusive design** – Prototypes should represent accessible final products
- **Early problem detection** – Catch accessibility issues before development
- **User research validity** – Ensure all participants can use your prototype
