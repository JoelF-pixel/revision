## What’s in Bioenergetics (Paper 1)

- Photosynthesis (equation, limiting factors)
- Required practical concepts (rate of photosynthesis)
- Aerobic respiration
- Anaerobic respiration (animals + plants)
- Response to exercise (oxygen debt, lactic acid)

## How it’s tested

- Required practical method + variables
- Graph interpretation (rate)
- Extended responses (4–6 marks)
