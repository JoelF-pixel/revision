## Teach (quick)

### Eukaryotes vs prokaryotes

- **Eukaryotic** cells (plants/animals): have a **nucleus**.
- **Prokaryotic** cells (bacteria): no nucleus; DNA is a **single circular loop** in the cytoplasm.
- Bacteria can have **plasmids** (extra small rings of DNA).

### Structures to recognise

**Animal cells**: nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, mitochondria, ribosomes.

**Plant cells**: everything in animal cells **plus** cell wall, chloroplasts, permanent vacuole.

**Bacterial cells** (prokaryote): cytoplasm, cell membrane, cell wall, circular DNA, plasmids (sometimes).

### Microscopy calculations

**Formula:**

- magnification = image size ÷ real size

Be careful with units:
- 1 mm = 1000 µm

## Worked examples

1) An image of a cell is 20 mm long. The real cell is 50 µm long. Calculate magnification.

- Convert 50 µm to mm: 50 µm = 0.05 mm
- magnification = 20 ÷ 0.05 = **400×**

2) A microscope image is 60 mm. The magnification is 300×. Calculate the real size.

- real size = image size ÷ magnification = 60 mm ÷ 300 = **0.2 mm = 200 µm**

## Practice

### MCQ

1) Which structure is found in plant cells but not animal cells?
- A Mitochondria
- B Cell membrane
- C Chloroplasts
- D Ribosomes

2) Which organelle is the site of aerobic respiration?
- A Ribosome
- B Mitochondrion
- C Nucleus
- D Vacuole

3) Which statement about bacteria is correct?
- A They have a nucleus
- B Their DNA is a single circular loop
- C They have chloroplasts
- D They are always larger than animal cells

4) If magnification = image size ÷ real size, then real size =
- A image size × magnification
- B image size ÷ magnification
- C magnification ÷ image size
- D image size + magnification

### Short answer

1) Give two differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. (2)

2) State the function of mitochondria. (1)

3) A cell image is 12 mm long. The real cell is 30 µm long. Calculate the magnification. (3)

## Mark scheme (condensed)

- Prokaryotes: **no nucleus**, DNA is **circular** (can mention plasmids)
- Eukaryotes: **nucleus** present
- Mitochondria: aerobic respiration / releases energy
- Calculation: convert units correctly; use magnification equation
