## Teach (quick)

### Diffusion
- Net movement of particles from **higher concentration → lower concentration**.
- Happens because particles move randomly.
- Faster when: bigger concentration difference, higher temperature, larger surface area, thinner membrane.

### Osmosis
- Diffusion of **water** through a **partially permeable membrane**.
- Water moves from a **more dilute** solution to a **more concentrated** solution.

### Active transport
- Movement of substances **against** a concentration gradient.
- Requires **energy** (from respiration).

## Worked example

**Question:** Why do root hair cells use active transport to take up mineral ions?

**Answer (mark-scheme style):** Because mineral ion concentration is often **lower** in the soil than inside the root hair cell, so ions must move **against** the concentration gradient and this requires **energy**.

## Practice

### MCQ (choose one)

1) Which process describes the movement of water through a partially permeable membrane?
- A Diffusion
- B Osmosis
- C Active transport
- D Respiration

2) Which process requires energy?
- A Diffusion
- B Osmosis
- C Active transport
- D Evaporation

3) In which direction do particles move in diffusion?
- A Low → high concentration
- B High → low concentration
- C Only into cells
- D Only out of cells

4) Why does diffusion happen?
- A Cells pull particles in
- B Particles move randomly
- C It requires energy
- D It only happens in water

5) Which change would increase the rate of diffusion?
- A Lower temperature
- B Smaller surface area
- C Bigger concentration difference
- D Thicker membrane

### Short answer (1–3 marks)

1) Define diffusion. (2)

2) Define osmosis. (2)

3) Explain why active transport is needed to absorb glucose in the small intestine after a meal has been digested. (3)

## Mark scheme (condensed)

- Diffusion: **net movement** from **high → low** concentration.
- Osmosis: **movement of water** through a **partially permeable membrane** from **dilute → concentrated**.
- Active transport: **against gradient**, uses **energy**.
