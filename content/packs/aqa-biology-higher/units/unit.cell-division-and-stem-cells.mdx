## Teach (quick)

### Cell cycle + mitosis

- Cells **grow** and **replicate DNA**.
- Then they divide by **mitosis** to produce **two genetically identical cells**.
- Mitosis is used for **growth** and **repair**.

### Stem cells

Stem cells can divide and then differentiate into other cell types.

- **Embryonic stem cells**: can become many cell types.
- **Adult stem cells**: more limited.
- **Plant stem cells** are in **meristems**.

### Risks + ethics

- Risks: infection, rejection, tumours.
- Ethics: embryonic stem cells involve destroying embryos.

## Practice

### MCQ

1) What does mitosis produce?
- A Two genetically different cells
- B Two genetically identical cells
- C Four genetically different cells
- D One genetically identical cell

2) Why must DNA be replicated before mitosis?
- A To make the cell bigger
- B So each new cell gets a full set of genetic material
- C To stop respiration
- D To increase diffusion

3) Where are plant stem cells found?
- A In mitochondria
- B In meristems
- C In vacuoles
- D In ribosomes

### Short answer

1) Describe the cell cycle at GCSE level (include DNA replication and mitosis). (3)

2) Give one benefit and one risk of using stem cells to treat disease. (2)

### Exam-style (6 marks)

Stem cells can be used to treat some diseases.

Evaluate the use of embryonic stem cells compared to adult stem cells. (6)

## Mark scheme (condensed)

- Mitosis: two identical cells; growth/repair
- DNA replication before division
- Meristems contain plant stem cells
- Embryonic: many cell types; ethical issues
- Adult: fewer ethical issues; limited differentiation
- Risks: rejection/infection/tumours
