## Required practical questions: what examiners want

Use this checklist:

- Aim (what are you investigating?)
- IV / DV
- Control variables (and how you control them)
- Method steps (clear, replicable)
- Risks + safety
- How you calculate rate / mean / % change
- How you improve reliability (repeat + mean)
- How you improve validity (control confounders)
