## How Paper 2 practical questions usually work

- They give you a scenario (fieldwork / distribution)
- You choose: quadrat or transect (or both)
- You explain:
  - where you sample
  - how often / how many repeats
  - what you measure
  - how you reduce bias

## Mark checklist

- clear method
- repeats + mean
- random sampling / systematic sampling
- limitations + improvements
