## Teach (quick)

### Cell differentiation

Cell differentiation is when a cell changes to become **specialised** for a particular function.

- Animals: most differentiation happens early.
- Plants: many cells can still differentiate later.

### Specialised cells (learn the adaptations)

- **Sperm cell**: tail for swimming; lots of mitochondria for energy.
- **Nerve cell**: long axon to carry electrical signals.
- **Muscle cell**: can contract (many mitochondria).
- **Root hair cell**: large surface area to absorb water/minerals.

### Organisation levels

- **Cells** → **tissues** → **organs** → **organ systems**

Example: muscle cell → muscle tissue → heart → circulatory system.

### Stem cells

Stem cells can divide and then differentiate into other cell types.

## Practice

### MCQ

1) A tissue is…
- A a group of organs working together
- B a group of similar cells working together
- C a single specialised cell
- D a group of different organ systems

2) Which is an adaptation of a sperm cell?
- A chloroplasts
- B tail
- C cell wall
- D large vacuole

3) Which statement about plant cells is correct?
- A plant cells never differentiate
- B plant cells can only differentiate before birth
- C plant cells can differentiate throughout life
- D plant cells have no specialised cells

4) Which sequence is correct?
- A organ → tissue → cell → organ system
- B cell → tissue → organ → organ system
- C cell → organ → tissue → organ system
- D tissue → cell → organ → organ system

### Short answer

1) Define cell differentiation. (1)

2) Explain one adaptation of a root hair cell. (2)

3) Give one benefit and one ethical issue of using embryonic stem cells. (2)

## Mark scheme (condensed)

- Differentiation: cell becomes specialised
- Root hair: large surface area / thin cell wall / many mitochondria (for active transport)
- Benefit: treat disease / replace damaged cells
- Ethical: embryo destroyed / moral/religious objections
