## You can…

- describe what happens to **animal cells** in dilute vs concentrated solutions
- describe what happens to **plant cells** in dilute vs concentrated solutions
- use the terms **turgid**, **flaccid**, **plasmolysed** correctly

## Quick definitions

- **Turgid**: plant cell swollen; cytoplasm pushes on cell wall.
- **Flaccid**: plant cell has lost water; not firm.
- **Plasmolysed**: plant cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall (very concentrated solution).
