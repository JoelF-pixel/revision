## You can…

- state the main differences between **prokaryotic** and **eukaryotic** cells
- name key structures in **animal**, **plant**, and **bacterial** cells

## Core facts

- **Eukaryotic cells** (animals/plants) have a **nucleus**.
- **Prokaryotic cells** (bacteria) do **not** have a nucleus; genetic material is a **single circular DNA loop**.
- Bacteria may also have **plasmids** (small DNA rings).
