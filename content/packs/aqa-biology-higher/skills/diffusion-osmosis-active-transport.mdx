## What you need to be able to do

- Explain **diffusion** as the net movement of particles from **high → low** concentration.
- Explain **osmosis** as the movement of **water** through a **partially permeable membrane** from a **dilute** solution to a **more concentrated** solution.
- Explain **active transport** as movement **against** a concentration gradient using **energy**.

## Common mistakes

- Mixing up *dilute/concentrated* with *high/low water potential* (keep it simple: dilute = more water).
- Saying osmosis is about *any* particles — it’s specifically **water**.
- Forgetting active transport needs **energy**.

## Quick self-check

1) Which processes need a membrane?
2) Which process needs energy?
3) What happens to an animal cell in a very dilute solution?
