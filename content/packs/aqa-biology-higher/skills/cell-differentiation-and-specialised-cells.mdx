## You can…

- define **cell differentiation**
- explain why specialised cells are adapted for their function

## Core idea

- In animals, most differentiation happens early.
- In plants, many cells keep the ability to differentiate throughout life.

## Examples to know (high yield)

- Sperm cell (tail, mitochondria)
- Nerve cell (long axon)
- Muscle cell (contracts)
- Root hair cell (large surface area)
- Xylem / phloem (transport)
